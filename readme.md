Insular
======================================

About
--------------------------------------

The player wakes up on an island, but everything is not what it seems. This game was made in under 48 hours as part of Global Game Jam 2016 at the Toronto George Brown College site. The theme was "Ritual".


Diversifiers
--------------------------------------

We elected to take inspiration from the following optional requirements for the Game Jam.

*Gandhi's Game*: This game must have zero violence in its game play. Conflicts must have resolutions based on logic.

*Story Mode*: No cutscenes, text boxes or interruption of gameplay. Use player actions for all your storytelling.

*LEGO got it right*: There are no spoken or written words in this game. This is even true in the instructions.
